//  ADDITIONAL INFO: Google Maps API: Main viewscreen, Reverse Geocoding for address, Markers on map,
//                   Google Places API: Search for location functionality. Tapping a location of the search moves the map to that location but it shows a random place first but if you drag the map, it will show the correct place.
//                                      Don't really know why this is happening or how to fix.
//                   Firebase database: Marker information (Address, Description, lat, lng, etc.). Timer runs every 10 sec and updates the map with any added or removed markers.
